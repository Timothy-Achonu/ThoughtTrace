Thoughts

Just to be sure you understand what I'm referring to as chats: When I say chats I mean a separate list of messages. For example, on whatsapp I have a chat with my brother, my sister, my friend, etc. Each of these chats have their own long lists of messages. I'm doing the same here but just that it's just one person. A user can decide to have a chat called 'journal for school' and another chat called 'journal for church'. So I'm asking if it makes sense to create each chat as a separate collection.
